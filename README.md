# üîó GCN-Accel: Open-Source RTL Graph Convolution Accelerator

**GCN-Accel** is an open-source SystemVerilog-based RTL implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) accelerator. It is designed for efficient processing of sparse graphs and neural network operations, making it suitable for custom ASIC or FPGA deployments in AI, edge computing, and research domains.

## üìÑ Description

This project offers a modular, synthesizable RTL design for accelerating GCN inference, with memory hierarchy support, FSM-based control logic, and simulation testbenches. It reads sparse matrix data (in COO format), performs feature transformations and matrix multiplications, and outputs transformed feature representations. Ideal for learning, prototyping, or deploying hardware-based GCNs.
